This repository showcases two key projects developed for the Robotic Systems module. Both projects leverage the Pololu 3Pi+ 32U4 platform to solve complex navigation and coordination tasks using sensor fusion, PID control, and kinematics.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** C++/Arduino

- **Hardware:** Pololu 3Pi+ 32U4 (ATmega32U4, 5-channel Line Sensors, Dual Encoders, IR Bumpers).

- **Algorithms:** PID Control, Differential Drive Kinematics, IR Signal Processing, Finite State Machines (FSM).

### 📂 Repository Structure
- Project1_LineFollowing: [Source code](https://github.com/ruiyongzhang/Robotics_Systems) for line tracking and odometry-based return.

- Project2_LeaderFollower: [Source code](https://github.com/Nolan-Nan/Robotics-System-888) and experimental data for the IR tracking study.

- /Docs: Technical reports and feedback logs.

# 🚀 Project 1: Autonomous Line Following & Strategic Home Return

### Overview
This project required the robot to follow a complex path marked by black lines on a map, identify specific milestones, and execute a "return to home" maneuver using pure odometry (Kinematics) once the path ended.

### Technical Implementation
- **Line Following:** Implemented using a 5-channel infrared reflectance sensor array. A Weighted Average algorithm was used to determine the robot's deviation from the line center.
- **PID Control:** A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller was tuned to provide smooth steering corrections, minimizing oscillations during high-speed cornering.
- **Kinematics (Odometry):** Using dual motor encoders, the robot tracked its own 2D coordinates $(X, Y)$ and heading $(\theta)$ in real-time.
- **State Machine:** The robot logic was structured as a Finite State Machine (FSM), transitioning between LINE_FOLLOWING, LOST_LINE, and GOHOME states.

### Execution
- **The "Home" Challenge:** After completing the circuit, the robot used its stored coordinates to calculate the inverse vector and drive back to $(0,0)$ without any external guidance.

# 🤖 Project 2: Leader-Follower Constant Distance System

### Overview
A study on multi-robot coordination where a "Follower" robot tracks a "Leader" robot. The goal was to maintain a constant separation distance while navigating a dynamic path, using integrated IR bump sensors.

### Key Research Questions
- How do different velocities and target distances affect the stability of the following behavior?
- What are the limitations of low-cost IR sensors in proximity detection?

### Experimental Methodology
The system was evaluated across a matrix of variables:
- **Target Distances:** $50mm$, $100mm$, $150mm$, $200mm$.
- **Velocities:** Tested at PWM duty cycles of 20, 30, and 40 (approx. $0.1m/s$ to $0.25m/s$).
- **Control Logic:** A Bang-Bang controller was implemented to adjust motor speeds based on calibrated IR intensity thresholds.

### Results & Critical Analysis
- **Optimal Performance:** Stability peaked at 10cm distance with Low Speed (PWM 20).
- **SNR Challenges:** As distance exceeded $15cm$, the signal-to-noise ratio of the IR sensors significantly degraded, leading to tracking failures.
- **Scientific Improvement:** Reflecting on academic feedback, this project highlights the importance of mapping PWM values to absolute physical units ($m/s$) and using statistical distributions (Violin Plots) rather than raw trajectory traces for robust data analysis.

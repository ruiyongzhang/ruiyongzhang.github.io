### 🌍 Project Overview
**Wandering on Earth** is a high-fidelity 3D simulation game developed in **Unity**. The core concept revolves around environmental restoration—players work to revive different parts of the Earth, including various terrains and ecosystems, within a limited time.

### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
As a core member of Team E at the **University of Bristol**, I contributed to several flagship technology implementations:

* **Real-time Network Physics:** We implemented a dynamic interaction algorithm with **lag compensation**, enabling seamless synchronization for up to **20 players** simultaneously.
* **High-Fidelity Rendering:** Utilized the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** and custom shaders to create a vivid, complex, and beautiful nature simulation.
* **Complex Asset Pipeline:** I worked with **Maya and Blender** to create and skeletonize models, ensuring they were optimized for real-time performance within Unity.
* **Advanced VFX:** Integrated complex particle systems and the **Cinemachine** camera system to enhance the immersive gameplay experience.

### 🎨 Design & Gameplay
In this world, players start by planting trees to improve air quality and soil environment. As the "Environmental Impact Assessment" score improves:
1.  **Ecosystem Rebirth:** Animals return to the habitat.
2.  **Human Integration:** Normal daily life resumes for human NPCs.
3.  **Collaborative Goals:** Players must communicate and coordinate asynchrony or synchronously to achieve global restoration.

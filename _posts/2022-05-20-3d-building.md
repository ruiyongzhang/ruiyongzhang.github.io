# Navigating the Maze: A 3D Solution for Indoor Pathfinding

![Project Overview](https://你的图片链接_可以放一张模型或UI截图.png)

### 📍 The Problem: Indoor Navigation
Large university buildings, like the **Queen’s Building** at the University of Bristol, are notorious for their complex layouts. Even staff with years of experience often find themselves lost when looking for specific meeting rooms or labs. My team and I developed **3DBuilding** to solve this—a web-based 3D application that provides intuitive, room-to-room navigation.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive 3D Modeling:** A virtual representation of the building where users can rotate, zoom, and even make walls invisible to identify room numbers clearly.
* **Intelligent Pathfinding:** Simply enter your current location and destination, and the app calculates the shortest path across multiple floors.
* **Accessibility Preferences:** Users can choose their preferred route—either using **stairs or lifts**—making the navigation inclusive for everyone.
* **Web-Based Accessibility:** No installation required; the app is hosted on the cloud and accessible via any modern browser.

### 🛠 Technical Deep Dive

#### 1. Pathfinding via Dijkstra’s Algorithm
The core of the navigation engine is a customized **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**. 
* **Multilayer Logic:** We implemented the algorithm to handle pathfinding separately for each floor and then combined them through "connection nodes" (stairs/lifts).
* **Data Structure:** Instead of a traditional database, we utilized a highly optimized **2D Array Matrix** to store room information and connectivity, ensuring lightning-fast path calculations within the browser.

#### 2. 3D Visualization with p5.js & Blender
To create the 3D experience without the overhead of a heavy game engine:
* **Hybrid Modeling:** We used **Blender** to assist in the initial spatial design and **p5.js (Processing)** for the real-time web rendering.
* **Interactive UX:** Features like "Transparent Walls" and "Floor Switching" were coded in JavaScript to allow users to see through the building structure and focus on their specific path.

#### 3. Cloud-Native Deployment (IBM Cloud & Kubernetes)
This project was a deep dive into modern DevOps practices:
* **Containerization:** The entire application was containerized using **Docker**.
* **Orchestration:** We deployed the app on **IBM Cloud** using **Kubernetes**, ensuring high availability and professional-grade hosting.

#### 4. Frontend Foundation: HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript
As a key contributor to the frontend, I built the application's core structure using standard web technologies:
* **HTML5 (Index):** Structured the single-page application (SPA) environment to host the 3D canvas and user control panels.
* **CSS3:** Designed a responsive and clean user interface, ensuring that the navigation controls and search bars were intuitive and "spoke for themselves."
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Acted as the "brain" of the frontend, handling real-time user inputs, managing state changes between different floors, and bridging the UI with the 3D rendering engine.

### 🚧 Challenges & Growth
This project was a steep learning curve for our team:
* **Zero-to-One Modeling:** Most team members had no prior experience in 3D modeling. We established an internal peer-learning system to master Blender and p5.js within weeks.
* **Collaborative Engineering:** Managing a complex project with multiple contributors taught us the importance of professional **GitHub Workflows** (Pull Requests, Branch Management) and task distribution.

### 📊 Impact & Feedback
Our client, a long-term researcher at the university, provided positive feedback, noting that the "Help Point" concept with a 3D model was significantly more intuitive than traditional 2D maps. This project stands as a testament to how software engineering can solve everyday campus challenges.
